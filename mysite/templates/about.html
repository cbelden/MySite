<!-- TODO : would like to increase the spacing between paragraphs -->
    <p>
        As you may have already guessed, I'm Calvin Belden: student, son, brother, friend, acquaintance, innovator, loyal confidant, and (to some) arch nemesis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Officially, I am a senior Electrical Engineering student at the University of Notre Dame.  I've picked up
        various Computer Science skills via coursework, internships, and personal investigation.  If you'd like, you can take a look at my resume <a href="{{url_for('static', filename='resume/resume.pdf')}}">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not working, studying, reading, or tinkering, you can find me out on the golf course shanking golf
        balls into beverage carts.  I also enjoy swimming, frequenting the local movie theater, and magnets.
