    <h4><em>Automated UI Testing</em>: C#</h4>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        This past summer I interned as a software test engineer at <a href="http://www.mts.com/en/index.htm" target="_blank">MTS Systems</a> in Eden Prairie, MN.  MTS produces testing devices for a variety of fields, and a rich Windows application, <a href="http://www.mts.com/testsuite/" target="_blank">TestSuite</a>, controls several of these devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was a member of the automated test team that worked with TestSuite, and I focused on developing the coded UI test framework.  The framework will drive nightly-run acceptance tests that will help minimize the risk of expensive bugs.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I also participated in the annual Hackathon and built a POC, web-based, intelligent phone service for customer feedback submissions.  The service allowed customers to query the status of existing feedback items, create new items, and receive updates: all over the phone.
    </p>

    <p>
        The summer of 2012 I interned as a software engineer at <a href="http://www.gentex.com/" target="_blank">Gentex</a>, a global car mirror manufacturer in Zeeland, Michigan.  I wrote diagnostic commands to communicate and send commands to the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, I also wrote integration tests to ensure the car mirror's core features were behaving appropriately.  I tested features like automatic dimming and displaying accurate compass and GPS information.

    <h4>HTML, CSS, Python</h4>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        calbelden.com started earlier this summer as a means to learn HTML and CSS; the website also served as an opportunity to keep my Python skills fresh.  The original hope was to use the knowledge learned here and apply it to a food ordering app geared towards Notre Dame's dorm restaurants, which are all student owned/runned.  Work for the ordering service will likely begin sometime this fall!
