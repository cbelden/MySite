    <h3 id="mts" style="padding-top: 40px; margin-top: -40px;">MTS Systems Corporation</h3>
    <h4>Languages: C#</h4>
    <p>
        This past summer I interned as a software test engineer at <a href="http://www.mts.com/en/index.htm" target="_blank">MTS Systems</a> in Eden Prairie, MN.  MTS produces test devices for a variety of fields including the materials, automotive, and aerospace industries.  MTS provides a rich Windows application, <a href="http://www.mts.com/testsuite/" target="_blank">TestSuite</a>, that controls several of these testing rigs.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was a member the automated test team that worked with TestSuite, and I spent the summer implementing UI drivers and writing UI test cases in C#.  It was rewarding converting tedious manual tests into automated processes that could be run every night (vs. at the end of every release!).

    <h3 id="gentex" style="padding-top: 40px; margin-top: -40px;">Gentex Corporation</h3>
    <h4>Languages: C, Ruby</h4>
    <p>
        The summer of 2012 I interned as a software engineer at <a href="http://www.gentex.com/" target="_blank">Gentex</a> in Zeeland, Michigan.  Gentex manufactures car mirrors, and I wrote commands to retrieve and send diagnostic information to and from the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
        One common task was retrieving and writing data stored in the mirror's EEPROM.  I also wrote integration tests to ensure that the mirror was performing appropriately (correctly dimming, displaying accurate compass readings, displaying accurate GPS information, etc.).

    <h3 id="this_site" style="padding-top: 40px; margin-top: -40px;">calbelden.com</h3>
    <h4>Languages - HTML, CSS, Python</h4>
    <p>
        I began calbelden.com earlier this summer to learn html and css; I also saw this as an opportunity to keep my Python skills fresh!  My hope is to use the knowledge I've learned here and apply it to a food ordering web-app geared towards Notre Dame's dorm restaurants, which are all student owned/runned).
