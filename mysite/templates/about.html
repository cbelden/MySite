    <h3>No Funny Business</h3>
    <p>
        Calvin is a senior Electrical Engineering student at the University of Notre Dame, though much of his free time has been dedicated to programming.  If you'd like, you can head to the <a href="/projects">projects</a> page to look at his technical experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        When he's not tinkering, you can find Cal shanking
        golf balls into beverage carts.  Weather permitting, it's also likely you'll catch him swimming in a nearby lake (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota#Geology_and_terrain" target="_blank">Fun Fact</a>: In Minnesota, there are more than 11,000 to choose from).
