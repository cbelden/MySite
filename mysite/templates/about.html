        <h3>Go time</h3>
        <p>
            I am a senior Electrical Engineering student at the University of Notre Dame, though much of my free time has been dedicated to programming.  You can head to the <a href="/projects">projects</a> page to look at my technical experience.

    <h3>Down time</h3>
    <p>
        When I'm not tinkering, you can find me shanking golf balls into beverage carts.  Other pastimes include but are not limited to: reading, swimming (sinking), redditing, exercising, and getting lost in a good movie.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Hopes</h3>
    <p>
        My immediate plans are to work in industry and absorb as much information as possible; I love learning new technologies, and I'm continuously working to extend my skillset.  In time, my goal is to own a product/project that benefits customers on a global scale!
