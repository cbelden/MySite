        <p>
            I am a senior Electrical Engineering student at the University of Notre Dame, though much of my free time has been dedicated to programming.  You can head to the <a href="/projects">projects</a> page to look at my technical experience.

    <h3>Down time</h3>
    <p>
        When I'm not tinkering, you can find me shanking golf balls into beverage carts.  Other pastimes include but are not limited to: reading, swimming (sinking), redditing, exercising, and getting lost in a good movie.
